                Tendinopathy is a general term that refers to tendons' swelling,
                pain, and inflammation. Tendons and bones both move when you
                tense or relax your muscles, and painful and swollen tendons can
                make it difficult to play sports, do housework, and other simple
                tasks.

                Experiencing a painful shoulder is a condition that can have
                many causes and manifests as discomfort in the shoulder's
                muscles, joints, tendons, and ligaments. Tendinopathy and
                painful shoulder are both conditions that require medical
                attention to avoid further complications. LaSara Medical Group
                offers effective and non-invasive extracorporeal shockwave
                therapy (ESWT) treatment for painful shoulder and tendinopathy.

              <p>
                If you are tired of having pain and limited mobility due to
                shoulder pain and tendinopathy, shockwave therapy could be the
                right solution for you. Shockwave therapy offers a non-invasive
                alternative to treatments like surgery and pain medications.
                Shockwave therapy is generally safe for anyone who is
                experiencing pain in the shoulder or wants to speed up their
                recovery. The best way to determine if you are the right fit for
                ESWT treatment for shoulder pain and tendinopathy is by
                scheduling a consultation with one of our offices.

                        Extracorporeal shockwave therapy works by delivering a
                        burst of energy to the treatment area. This burst of
                        energy triggers the body's healing response, increases
                        blood flow, and promotes new cell production. Shockwave
                        therapy is a painless outpatient treatment that can help
                        alleviate pain, reduce swelling, and increase mobility
                        in those suffering from shoulder pain and tendinopathy.
                        Weâ€™ve had tremendous success with patients who have pain
                        from surfing, tennis, old injuries, and post-surgical.

                        The exact number of treatments needed to alleviate your
                        shoulder discomfort will be determined by your provider

                        Typically, we recommend receiving three to six
                        treatments spread over three to six weeks for best
                        results. Most patients report that they notice an
                        improvement in their symptoms after the first treatment.
                        However, you can expect to continue getting beneficial
                        effects in the weeks and months after you complete your
                        treatments.
