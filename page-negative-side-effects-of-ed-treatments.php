                    <p>Erectile dysfunction is an uncomfortable and annoying problem that affects many men at some point in their lives. You may feel rushed to run out and start the first treatment you can find. But taking some time to educate yourself on potential side effects ensures that you make the best decision on what treatment is right for you.</p>
                    <p class="m-0">Before deciding on what type of treatment is right for you, you should be well aware of potential side effects. Below are a few of the side effects that come with certain ED treatments.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacology</h2>
                    <p>Prescription pills like Viagra and Cialis are often the first treatment types that come to mind when people think about ED treatments. But these pills are not without their problems.</p>
                    <p>ED drugs are designed to increase nitric acid in your blood which increases blood flow. But this increase in blood flow can come with side effects. Headaches are the most common side effect associated with ED pills, but you may also experience dizziness, flushing, aches and pains, and stomach problems. Regardless of which pill you are using, the rapid boost in blood flow can cause these problems.</p>
                    <p class="m-0">There are more severe possible side effects. Priapism, which is an erection that lasts for more than four hours, sudden changes in hearing, and vision loss are all serious problems that need to be seen and treated by a doctor right away.</p>

                    <p class="m-0">Penis pumps also come with their share of side effects. Typically they are less severe than those associated with pharmacology. Pain or bruising, pinpoint-sized red dots, and the feeling of trapped semen may occur. The erection also may not feel natural due to the lack of firmness in the base.</p>

                    <h2>Surgery</h2>
                    <p>Some men opt for surgery after exhausting all other  <a href="<?php echo get_site_url() ?>/services/erectile-dysfunction-shockwave-therapy" class="text-primary-light">erectile dysfunction treatment</a> options. Surgery for erectile dysfunction comes with the risk that every surgery has: infection, bleeding, and reaction to anesthesia.</p>
                    <p class="m-0">It also comes with risks specific to penile surgery. Once implants are used, the penis will never be able to get erect on its own again. This means if the surgery doesn’t work you’ll need to try implants again. Implants may also fail and need to be replaced.</p>
