            There are many causes of erectile dysfunction (ED): stress, genetics, medications, and lifestyle choices, just to name a few. However, no matter the cause of ED, this common issue can be a frustrating and demoralizing experience for men. Fortunately, the use of pharmaceuticals for treating ED has proven to be an effective and straightforward way to improve both sexual desire and performance in men. LaSara Medical Group in Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego, CA, offers pharmaceutical options for treating ED in men.

              What are Medications for Erectile Dysfunction?

            Pharmaceutical treatments for erectile dysfunction are a popular way to treat issues like lack of libido, decreased sexual satisfaction, difficulties with erections, and more. However, each individual is different and may require different treatment options. This is why LaSara Medical Group offers a variety of pharmaceutical treatments to suit your specific needs.
          </p>
          <p>After your initial appointment, your LaSara Medical Group provider can recommend a treatment plan that will deliver your desired results. Our practice offers the following pharmaceuticals for the treatment of ED:
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-3 offset-lg-1 align-self-start">
          <h3>Tadalafil</h3>
          <p>
            Tadalafil is a proven erectile dysfunction medication, and its effects are cumulative and improve with daily use. It's effective for both males and females. Tadalafil orally can be effective in increasing sexual desire, sexual arousal, sexual orgasm, and sexual satisfaction. It increases nitric oxide in the corpus cavernosum of men.
          </p>
          <br /><br /><br /><br />
          <h3>Oxytocin</h3>
          <p>
            While Oxytocin certainly lives up to its reputation as the "Love Hormone," it also has broader applications like weight management and a performance enhancer. Oxytocin is elevated during sexual arousal, skin-to-skin contact, and orgasm. Due to this, research has been conducted and shown that exogenous administration of Oxytocin can improve libido, orgasm intensity/frequency, and sexual pleasure. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-3 offset-lg-1 align-self-start">
          <h3>Sildenafil</h3>
          <p>
            Sildenafil is used to treat men who have erectile dysfunction (also called sexual impotence). Sildenafil belongs to a group of medicines called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. These medicines prevent an enzyme called phosphodiesterase type-5 from working too quickly. The penis is one of the areas where this enzyme works. By controlling the enzyme, sildenafil helps to maintain an erection after the penis is stroked.
          </p>
          <h3>Vardenafil</h3>
          <p>
            Vardenafil treats erectile dysfunction (impotence; inability to get or keep an erection) in men. Vardenafil is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. It works by increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation. This increased blood flow can cause an erection.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-3 offset-lg-1 align-self-start">
          <h3>TriMix, known as Penile Injections</h3>
          <p>
            TriMix is used for male sexual function. It is an intracavernosal three-drug injectable prescribed medication used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). TriMix describes a mixture of Papaverine, Phentolamine, and Alprostadil (PGE). Each of these drugs produces a vasodilating effect when injected into the penis. The injection is done using a tiny needle inserted into the proper area along the shaft of the penis, so the drug mixture is delivered into the corpus cavernosum. The mixture of drugs causes the corpus cavernosum to relax, dilate and fill with blood, resulting in penile erection. As a result, trimix can provide a longer and fuller erection that may be sustained through orgasm, allowing for an improved sexual experience.
