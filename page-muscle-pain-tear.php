                exercise, prolonged sitting or laying down, strains, and

                perform your job.

                No one likes to be in pain, and when it’s something as severe as
                a muscle tear, or an injury of the muscle or tendons, the pain
                can be debilitating. LaSara Medical Group offers extracorporeal

                Painful sports injuries can range from inconvenient to
                debilitating, but muscle pain and tears don’t have to mean
                lengthy recovery. Shockwave therapy offers a noninvasive
                approach to treating pain and supporting your body’s recovery.
              </p>
              <p class="m-0">
                Shockwave therapy works by delivering focused energy waves to
                injured soft tissues to reduce pain and promote healing. The
                procedure activates the body’s natural healing process,
                encourages cell regeneration, and stimulates blood flow to the
                area. Because shockwave therapy works directly with the body’s
                natural processes, its results last longer than those of
                medications. For those who treat muscle pain and tears with
                shockwave, they can expect their healing time to be
                significantly reduced.

              </h2>

              <p class="mb-0">
                Shockwave therapy is a simple and affordable procedure that
                provides long-term relief for muscle pain and tear. If you are
                over 18 years of age and suffer from chronic or acute muscle
                pain, you are a great candidate for receiving shockwave therapy.
                Shockwave therapy is a generally safe treatment that has very
                minimal side effects. However, individuals with certain
                conditions like hemophilia, skin infection of the area needing
                treatment, and circulation disorders may not be suitable for
                shockwave therapy and should consult their doctor before
                treatment.

                        Shockwave therapy is broadly and successfully used for
                        pain reduction and works by decreasing the number of
                        chemical messengers that transmit and receive pain.
                        Shockwave therapy treatments often help alleviate pain
                        and negate the need for more severe and invasive
                        treatments such as surgery. The way you respond to
                        treatment largely depends on your body’s healing
                        response. Although we recommend receiving at least three
                        treatments, you can start experiencing beneficial
                        results of shockwave therapy after just one visit.
