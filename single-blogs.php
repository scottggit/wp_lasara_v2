                        <p>If you have erectile dysfunction and you are seeking help to overcome it, be prepared to
                            be subjected to the many scams claiming to "cure" or "reverse" your ED.</p>
                        <p>Sadly, we live in a world where we can no longer take all doctors for their word. But we
                            also live in a world where information and research sit just a few clicks away. It is
                            LaSara Medical Group’s advice that you do your due diligence to fact check the many
                            claims that revolve around treating erectile dysfunction.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>In this blog, we will use facts to shed light on the most recent and growing scam in
                            Men's Sexual Health... that be the scam of "at home ED treatment devices" or "at home
                            shockwave device for ED treatment."</p>
                        <p>If after reading this content you are stimulated with questions, I encourage you to
                            contact LaSara Medical Group. We offer our erectile dysfunction treatments in Los
                            Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>What are the false claims of at home treatment devices?</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>At home treatment devices are the same as a shockwave device used in a medical
                                clinic</li>
                            <li>The research of shockwave therapy used the same energy as “at home treatment
                                devices”</li>
                            <li>Acoustic wave devices are the same as shockwave devices&nbsp;</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Fact Check:</strong>&nbsp;At home treatment devices are the same as a shockwave
                            device used in a medical clinic.</p>
                        <p>The answer is NO. A very firm NO. At home devices are most definitely not the same as a
                            true shockwave device used by physicians in a clinical and research setting.</p>
                        <p>The first problem with this statement is shockwave devices are Class III medical devices
                            that come with FDA regulations which control the distribution and use of these devices.
                            In order to acquire a real shockwave device for medical treatment, you must first be a
                            licensed physician.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Shockwave as an energy is an amazing tool for many medical problems, but it also holds a
                            lot of power and can cause harm to the body if used incorrectly. In the simplest
                            explanation, there are three levels of intensity for shockwaves - low, moderate, and
                            high. Each of these levels triggers a different response in the body. The lower the
                            setting the more therapeutic the response and the higher the setting the more
                            destructive. Low intensity draws nutrients and blood flow to the treatment area, while
                            high intensity can be used to break down kidney stones or other calcification.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, it is nearly impossible to acquire or sell a real shockwave device to
                            the general public. Any device for at home use that claims to be a real shockwave is
                            nothing more than a lie.</p>
                        <p>In fact, one of the at home treatment device providers who sells their device for over
                            $1,000 has simply private labeled an ultrasound device that can be purchased for $150
                            from Walmart. Here’s the product: <a
                                href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/US-PRO-2000-DU3035-With-Free-Subzero-Pain-Relief-Roll-On-Gel-Home-use-Drug-Free-Pain-Relief-for-Personal-Care/200058601">https://www.walmart.com/ip/US-PRO-2000-DU3035-With-Free-Subzero-Pain-Relief-Roll-On-Gel-Home-use-Drug-Free-Pain-Relief-for-Personal-Care/200058601</a>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Fact Check:</strong>&nbsp;The research of shockwave therapy used the same energy
                            as the “at home treatment devices.”</p>
                        <p>Again… NO. Sadly, each at home treatment device is being presented with the research of
                            shockwave therapy, but at home devices do not emit real shockwaves. Shockwave therapy
                            was originally studied for treating ED in 2010. Dr. Yoram Vardi of Israel first studied
                            the use of a “focused shockwave” to reverse the vascular decay in the penis. &nbsp;This
                            focused energy penetrates the skin of the penis with repeated single shocks. This energy
                            is what triggers the growth of new blood vessels and the regeneration of soft tissue
                            inside the Corpus Cavernosum. The shockwave energy is typically measured between .1 and
                            .25 mj/mm<sup>2</sup>. These energy levels are considered low-intensity extracorporeal
                            shockwave therapy.</p>
                        <p>To date, no other type of energy has been used in the research of treating vasculogenic
                            erectile dysfunction.</p>
                        <p>If you are sitting at home reading this blog and holding your at home treatment device,
                            please try to identify a setting that allows you to measure the intensity of that energy
                            with mj/mm<sup>2</sup>. Unfortunately, you will not be able to because shockwave devices
                            are not sold to the general public because it is unsafe and against the law. Plus, they
                            cost about $50,000.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fact Check:</strong> Acoustic wave devices are the same as shockwave devices.</p>
                        <p>No. This is not true. If you take the time to dig a little deeper into the differences of
                            shockwaves versus acoustic waves, you will find two truths; 1) they are two different
                            types of energy and 2) the therapeutic response the body experiences with each energy is
                            drastically different.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, in every piece of research there is a section called “materials and
                            methods.” This section will name the exact device used in the research and even list the
                            level of energy used during treatment. On page 6 of this metanalysis, <a
                                href="https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/134018.pdf">https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/134018.pdf</a>,
                            you will find the great majority of studies used a focused shockwave device. Not a
                            single one of them used an ultrasound or acoustic wave device regardless of what the “at
                            home device” companies claim. If you have purchased an at home device, you have
                            experienced a bait and switch. &nbsp;</p>
