                    <h2>Prevalence</h2>
                    <p>According to the <a href="http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/endocrinology/erectile-dysfunction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary-light">Cleveland Clinic</a>, 40% of men have experienced erectile dysfunction by age 40. By age 70 that number climbs up to 70% This figure shows just how commonly ED affects men. Age certainly increases your chances of having ED, but young people are also affected.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, experiencing ED a couple times and having serious ED are two very different things. Only 5% of men at age 40 have erectile dysfunction while 15% have it at age 70. </p>
                    <p>A <a href="http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/endocrinology/erectile-dysfunction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary-light">Massachusetts’</a> male aging study showed that there will be approximately 617,715 new cases of ED in the United States annually. This staggering number shows the importance of proper treatment of and education about ED.</p>

                    <p>Men with <a href="<?php echo get_site_url() ?>/services/erectile-dysfunction-shockwave-therapy" class="text-primary-light">erectile dysfunction</a> are likely to experience a loss of confidence because their self-image is negatively affected. They may develop a fear of developing new intimate relationships due to worry about not being able to sexually satisfy their partner. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, this angst can affect other parts of life. Guilt and worry can lead men into depression which only serves to exacerbate the situation.</p>
                    <p class="m-0">The significant other of the affected party also can have psychological issues. They may feel guilt for not being able to arouse their partner or a loss of confidence despite the cause being physical.</p>

                    <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
                    <p>According to the Cleveland Clinic, “Recognized risk factors for ED include cardiovascular disease (hypertension, atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidemia), diabetes, depression, alcohol use, smoking, pelvic/perineal surgery or trauma, neurologic disease, obesity, pelvic radiation, and Peyronie disease”</p>
                    <p> This long list of risks makes it clear that ED can be a symptom of a more serious underlying disease. ED can be caused by blood flow issues, psychological issues, nerve issues, and muscular issues. As such, it is essential that someone suffering from ED see a doctor, especially if the problem has been present over 2 months. A well-rounded health plan can address underlying causes and potentially solve ED. </p>
                    <p class="m-0">According to <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/kidney_and_urinary_system_disorders/impotenceerectile_dysfunction_85,P01482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary-light">Hopkins Medicine</a>, 10.9 million adult men in the U.S have diabetes and 35 to 50% of these men have ED. The nerves controlling erections can be affected by diabetes. Diabetes may also cause premature hardening of the arteries.</p>

                    Hopkins Medicine also states that the primary barrier between couples dealing with ED is communication. This can impede the seeking of proper treatment. Women are also affected when their partners experience ED. Open and honest communication as well as seeking treatment can help alleviate the issues caused by ED.
