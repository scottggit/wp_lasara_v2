                of neuropathy, you know how frustrating and difficult numbness,
                tingling, or severe pain can be in your everyday life.
                Neuropathy is a nerve disorder that affects arms, legs, hands,
                and feet, with symptoms usually progressing over time. If you
                are ready to get back to enjoying your life, be sure to explore

                Neuropathy can be caused by diabetes, chemotherapy, alcoholism,
                and heavy metals. But at times, the cause of this nerve-damaging
                condition can be hard to pinpoint and even harder to treat. Many
                people are told that their only options for treatment are
                medications or learning to live with the pain.
              </p>
              <p class="m-0">
                Fortunately, with the help of medical advancements, individuals
                looking to reduce painful symptoms of neuropathy now have access
                to innovative extracorporeal shockwave treatments for reducing
                nerve-related pain. Shockwave therapy works by delivering
                high-energy shockwaves to the damaged tissues and nerves to
                accelerate the healing process. Shockwave therapy is a safe,
                non-invasive treatment option that does not have any of the
                dangerous side effects of neuropathy medications. For that
                reason, patients are turning to shockwave therapy for the relief
                of nerve pain and regeneration of the normal function of their
                nerves.
