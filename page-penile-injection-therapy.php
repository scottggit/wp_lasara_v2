                Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve and
                maintain an erection. ED is a condition that affects up to 40%
                of men by age 40 and this number only grows as the demographic
                ages. Regardless of the underlying cause, erectile dysfunction
                can be a source of low self-confidence, stress, and relationship
                strain. Fortunately, innovative treatments like penile
                injections at LaSara Medical Group offer a way to treat erectile
                dysfunction effectively.

                Some men are unable or choose not to address their erectile
                dysfunction with oral medication. Intracavernous injections,
                often referred to as tri-mix injections, offer an easy and
                popular solution for the condition. Intracavernous injections
                have been used as a treatment for ED since the 1980s and provide
                immediate results with a sterling 95% rate of effectiveness in
                treating ED.
              </p>
              <p>
                An intracavernous injection delivers a combination of medication
                directly into your penis. You perform the injection yourself,
                usually about 10-15 minutes before intercourse, and you can
                learn to administer these injections in as little as one office
                visit.
              </p>
              <p>
                While many men don't like the thought of injections directly
                into the penis, the dependable results far outweigh the
                momentary discomfort of the injection. Furthermore, the syringe
                is one of the smallest used in medicine today. Most men compare
                the sensation of the injection to that of a mosquito bite.

                        Penile injections consist of a combination of
                        medications that work together to relax smooth muscle
                        and open the blood vessels in the penis. The tissue that
                        causes you to gain an erection is a muscle, and
                        delivering this medication directly into the muscle can
                        be an effective treatment for even the most severe cases
                        of erectile dysfunction.

                        once concerns that repeated injections could cause liver
                        toxicity, retrospective studies have shown these

                        the correct injection procedure you learn from your
