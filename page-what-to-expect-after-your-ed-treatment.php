                    <p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common disorder, and while numerous therapeutic approaches have been taken over the years to deal with it, LaSara Clinic offers you the latest in <a href="<?php echo get_site_url(); ?>/erectile-dysfunction-shockwave-therapy">ED treatment.</a> We’re talking about low intensity focused shockwave therapy, that’s totally painless and designed to make you feel like you’re 21 again!
</p>
                    <p>We know focused shockwave therapy might sound a bit frightening, but we assure you, there’s nothing to fear and no anesthesia is required. Each session lasts about 20 minutes during which one of our trained professionals will use an external probe to administer low intensity electronic shockwaves to the penis and surrounding erectile tissue. The only thing you might feel is a light tapping sensation or perhaps a slight tingle, nothing more. 
</p>
<p>
                    You will need six treatment sessions over three weeks. Each session is held in our clinic (no hospitalization required), and after each, you can resume your normal daily activities.</p>

              Some men feel as though <a href="<?php echo get_site_url(); ?>/erectile-dysfunction-shockwave-therapy">erectile dysfunction</a> is uncomfortable to talk about, however, it is a quite common problem that affects many men. According to the National Institute of Health, 5 percent of 40-year olds and 15 to 25 percent of 65-year olds have ED. Despite those statistics we believe men should be able to have satisfying sex as they age, and we want to pass along a number of dos and don’ts that hopefully will help you achieve exactly that.
