                As we go through the natural aging process, our skin begins to
                lose its elasticity, resulting in sagging, wrinkles, and uneven
                tone. Additionally, diminished collagen and elastin production
                associated with the aging process can negatively affect the
                face's fragile skin, making it appear dull, loose, and wrinkled.
                LaSara Medical Group utilizes focused shockwave therapy to
                effectively tighten and rejuvenate your skin so you can look as
                youthful as you feel.

                Focused shockwave therapy for skin tightening is an innovative, non-invasive, and
                effective treatment that utilizes low-intensity extracorporeal
                shockwaves to generate single bursts of energy. When used on
                your facial skin, the repetitive bursts of energy causes
                micro-traumas that activate the body's natural healing process.
                The healing process encourages the body to release growth
                factors that help stimulate circulation and collagen production,
                promoting smoother and more youthful-looking skin.

                  Focused shockwave therapy is a non-invasive treatment that is
                  generally safe for most people. However, certain conditions
                  like a skin infection or hemophilia may prevent you from
                  receiving shockwave therapy. If you have any questions or
                  concerns about your eligibility to receive focused shockwave
                  therapy treatment, our helpful staff will gladly answer your
