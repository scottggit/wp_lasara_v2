                Shockwave therapy is one of the most cutting-edge techniques
                currently being used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction
                (ED). Shockwave therapy uses single pulses of energy that travel
                faster than the speed of sound to stimulate blood flow to the
                affected area. These pulses of energy create new blood vessels
                through a process called neovascularization. Blood flow is vital
                for achieving and maintaining an erection. When healthy, the
                blood vessels that feed blood flow to your penis dilate and
                expand 2.5x their normal width and fill up with blood to create
                an erection. When you have erectile dysfunction, the blood
                vessels have hardened and lost their ability to expand. They
                function similar to a pinched pipe where there is some flow, but
                not enough pressure to create an erection. Since 2009, using
                low-intensity focused shockwaves has been shown to be effective
                in treating erectile dysfunction and stimulating blood flow to
                the penis.

                        Most men have trouble with erections at some point in
                        their lives. But how do you know when you're truly
                        experiencing erectile dysfunction? The basic definition
                        of erectile dysfunction is the inability to achieve or
                        maintain an erection firm enough for sex. If this occurs
                        frequently, it can put stress on you, your relationship,
                        or your self-confidence, so it's important to seek help.

                        Experiencing different medical conditions such as
                        diabetes or other vascular diseases are typically the
                        cause of a man’s erectile dysfunction, but they do not
                        impact your ability to receive treatment. Vascular
                        diseases cause the vessels to close down, whereas
                        shockwaves cause the blood vessels to open up and
                        function naturally. If you have a history of these
                        conditions, then shockwave therapy is the best option
                        for repairing your blood flow.

                        Yes, shockwave therapy is a regenerative treatment that
                        clears out the plaque and creates new pathways for blood
                        flow. Typically, the ED pills stop working because your
                        blood vessels have closed down and hardened. At this
                        point, ED pills are no longer strong enough to
                        counteract the closure. By stimulating the body with
                        shockwaves, we present the opportunity to reverse such
                        closure and restore you back to normal erectile function
                        without the use of ED medications.
