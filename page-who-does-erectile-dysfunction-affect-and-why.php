              The risk of developing ED goes up significantly as you age. However, old age does not cause erectile dysfunction, it only increases the risk of it.

                    <p>A Cleveland Clinic <a href="https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/myths-and-facts-about-erectile-dysfunction#1" target='_blank'>study</a> detailed just how common erectile dysfunction is. At age 40, 40% of men had experienced erectile dysfunction with that number increasing to 70% by age 70. Moreover, from the age of 40 to 70, the prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction in men increases from 5% to 15%. Patients with heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes all were at greater risk of having ED. 
</p>
<p>
                    While smoking wasn’t shown as a direct cause of ED in the Cleveland Clinic’s study, the side effects of smoking were shown to cause ED. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Men over 75 are  <a href="https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/myths-and-facts-about-erectile-dysfunction#1" target='_blank'>more</a> likely to experience erectile dysfunction. But a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12179/abstract;jsessionid=C1069CF0998F858255467C8380FD9176.d02t01" target='_blank'>study</a> published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine showed that 1 in 4 men who present with a new case of ED are actually under 40. This bit of information actually helps to shed light on why certain people are affected by ED. Vascular diseases—diseases which affect blood flow—can lower blood flow to different organs. Vascular disease can therefore cause ED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A healthy lifestyle can be an effective remedy for vascular diseases. Cutting out smoking, increasing activity level, and getting restful sleep are all extremely important as well as a healthy diet.</p>

                    <h2>ED Affects More than Just Men</h2>
                    <p>Erectile dysfunction doesn’t just affect men. The strain put on a relationship with ED is a very real issue that must be handled with care. The additional stress, anxiety, and self-confidence issues can take a physical toll. 
</p><p>
                    Erectile dysfunction can have significant mental effects on women. Despite men explicitly stating that it has nothing to do with them, partners of people with ED are likely to feel guilt and low self-esteem. Stress levels can increase greatly after dealing with ED. Uncertainty of reproduction through natural means can also cause tremendous strain on couples exeperiencing ED. 
</p><p>
                    But erectile dysfunction doesn’t have to take such a toll on a relationship. It is important to be open and honest discussing the topic with your partner, no matter how uncomfortable it might be. Taking steps to actively solve the problem rather than trying to go without sexual intimacy is extremely important.
