                        Hexarelin is a synthetic growth hormone-releasing peptide that stimulates GHRH release. It's the strongest one that also increases cortisol and prolactin. However, it does not increase appetite, making it a helpful peptide for fat loss.

                        BPC-157 is a peptide with numerous uses. It is a 15-amino acid peptide derived from body protection compound (BPC) in human digestive stomach juices. Studies show it accelerates the healing of many tissues, including those that typically heal slowly, such as tendons and ligaments. BPC-157 also balances systemic inflammation, increases blood flow to damaged tissues, and relieves pain.

                        Semax is a 7-amino acid peptide that comes from amino acids 4 â€“ 10 of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Typically, the body produces ACTH as a stress hormone, but Semax, in particular, has many unique properties, such as stimulating neuronal growth and immune function. It's said to induce the good parts of stress, such as high and enhanced performance, without anxiety. So, you can perform and learn with minimal resistance and procrastination. </p>

                    <p>
                        Pinealon is a 3-amino acid peptide that can reverse brain aging and protect brain tissues against hypoxia and cellular suicide (apoptosis). Due to its small size, it can cross the blood-brain barrier. Once it enters the cells, it can directly interact with DNA and change genetic readouts.

                        Thymosin alpha 1 is a 28-amino acid peptide naturally found in the human thymus. While it helps modify, enhance, and restore immune function at the right time, it also promotes a balanced immune response and prevents excessive activation. Most importantly, it works with your body's natural immune responses.

Naturally, the gene that produces this peptide tends to be the first to become dysregulated after injuries.
