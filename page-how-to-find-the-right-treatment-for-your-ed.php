                    <h2>Research Treatment Methods</h2>
                    <p>What’s right for someone else isn’t necessarily right for you. A person’s erectile dysfunction treatment is highly dependent on the individual’s issues and preferences. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>Before setting foot into a doctor’s office, arm yourself with information by educating yourself on the different treatment methods. Pharmacology, pumps, surgery, and low-intensity shockwave therapy all come with benefits and drawbacks. The more you know about your treatment options, the more power you can take over your situation.
                    </p><p>    
                    This knowledge allows you to advocate for yourself. Rather than going to a doctor and hoping he picks the best course of action for you, you can be sure you take the right path.

                    <p>Trust is extremely important when choosing a doctor. With a problem as sensitive as your ED you’ll want a doctor who has a lot of experience but is also up to date on the latest research.
</p>
<p>    
                    Consumer Reports recommends checking whether your doctor is certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties by going to certificationmatters.org. They also recommend asking your doctor about drug reps because some may have a bias to give you drugs that are pitched to them.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to erectile dysfunction, it’s important to see your doctor as soon as possible. Unfortunately, ED can be a signal of a more serious underlying condition like cardiovascular disease or diabetes. As soon as you find a physician you can trust, schedule an appointment to get a full checkup.
