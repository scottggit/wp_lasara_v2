                    <p>The penis is an organ, which means standard nutrition and diet principles apply. A simple rule of thumb is that any food that’s bad for a man’s heart is also bad for his penis. Recent studies have shown that ED is relatively uncommon among men who eat a traditional Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, heart-healthy fats like nuts and olive oil, and red wine.</p>

                    <p>Being overweight can bring on many health issues including type 2 diabetes, which can lead to extensive nerve damage. Erectile Dysfunction can result if diabetes affects the nerves supplying the penis.</p>

                    <p>Smoking contributes to ED both in the short-term and the long-term. In the short-term, smoking constricts the blood vessels needed for an erection. In the long-term, nicotine contributes to a hardening of the arteries that can lead to ED.</p>

                    <p>High blood pressure and/or high cholesterol can damage the blood vessels bringing blood to the penis, and this may eventually lead to ED. Have both these checked regularly.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold">Exercise regularly</h3>
                    <p>Running, swimming and other aerobic exercises are known to help prevent ED. However, watch out for any exercise that puts excessive pressure on the perineum, the area between the scrotum and anus. Both the nerves and blood vessels that serve the penis can be negatively affected by excessive pressure in this area. Bicycling, in particular, can be problematic. If you ride a great deal, wear padded pants and consider getting a “no-nose” bike seat that relieves pressure in this area.</p>

                    <p>Psychological stress boosts adrenaline levels, constricting blood vessels and possibly contributing to ED. Anything a man can do to ease stress and feel better emotionally should give his sex life a boost.</p>
