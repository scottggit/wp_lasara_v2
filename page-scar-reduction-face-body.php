                If you are looking to improve the appearance of scars on your
                face or body, shockwave therapy can offer an affordable and
                non-invasive solution. Shockwave therapy does not require any
                downtime and you can return to regular activities immediately
                following the treatment. While shockwave therapy is a safe and
                non-invasive procedure, you may not be a good candidate for it
                if you have a skin infection in the treatment area or are under
                the age of 18. If you have any questions about your eligibility
                to receive shockwave therapy treatment, don’t hesitate to
                schedule a consultation with one of our offices. Our friendly
                staff is happy to answer all of your questions!

                        Shockwave therapy is a popular scar reduction treatment
                        due to the low possibility of side effects associated
                        with the procedure. Most side effects are short-lived
                        and will resolve on their own shortly after treatment.
                        You may notice slight reddening, swelling, or bruising
                        in the treatment area immediately after your
                        appointment. However, you can rest assured that
                        shockwave therapy is not associated with any serious
                        side effects.
